// The release index: every release an updater may go to, signed with the release key like
// a manifest. It lives at a stable address that does not depend on GitHub's "latest"
// release: the assets of a pre-release tagged "updates", which never becomes "latest".
//
//	{"schema": 1, "published": "…", "releases": [
//	  {"version": "0.5.0.1", "channel": "stable", "from": "0.4.5",
//	   "manifest": "https://github.com/GetsuNoKaze/kinkan/releases/download/v0.5.0.1/manifest.json"}]}
//
// An entry only points to its release's manifest, which is fetched and verified exactly
// as before. from is the lowest installed version that can update to the release directly.
//
// The format only ever grows, because every updater out there reads it:
//   - unknown fields, top level or in an entry, are ignored;
//   - an entry with an unparsable version, an unknown channel or a missing field is
//     skipped, never fatal: a later release may add entries an older reader does not
//     understand, and the rest must still work;
//   - schema stays 1 for as long as the file is called index.json: a format older
//     readers cannot read goes to a new file name, never a new meaning here;
//   - "rollout" (a percentage of servers that take a release) is reserved for later: a
//     reader may find it in an entry and ignores it for now.
